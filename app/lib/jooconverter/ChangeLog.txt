JOOConverter 2.0rc2

Due to popular demand JOOConverter, while still being part of JOOReports, is now
released as a standalone project (as it was already the case with the 1.0 series).

Changes compared to the version included in JOOReports 2.0rc1

 * added the converter web application

 * made jar file executable with ConvertDocument as main class

 * added (but unsupported) HTML and XHTML export formats

 * minor bug fixes
